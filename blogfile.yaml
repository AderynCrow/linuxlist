        Anyways, steamos is a linux distro with a long history. It has made it's way
        around the world on media PCs, and handheld consoles. It has quite the legacy.
        Unlike other distros, I argue SteamOS is trans.  This is because up to version 3
        , it used Debian as a base. After this, it used Arch. Now a basis is a quite
        important piece of a distro's identity, and as such, switching it makes SteamOS
        technically trans. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
