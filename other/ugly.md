# This site is ugly.

This site is one of the worst websites I've ever seen because it's dark theme and has a hundred links.

To fix this we have a few options.

## Option 1: Deal with it

If it's ugly, so what, who cares.

## Option 2: Use inbuilt tools

You can view this site in dracula theme with the stylus extension.

The `.user.css` file is behind [this link](/other/dracula.user.css){:target="_blank"}.

## Option 3: Be the cool

You can write your own user style and contribute it to the repo!

(*Please,* I want the Catppuccin siblings to enjoy this site in their colors.)
